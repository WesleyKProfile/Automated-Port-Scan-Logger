# Automated Port Scan Logger

## Objective
The Automated Port Scan Logger is designed to execute multiple Nmap scans, empowering users to specify both the IPv4 address to be scanned and the Nmap operators to employ. This automated scanner serves a multitude of purposes, including basic penetration testing, network troubleshooting, intrusion detection, and beyond. Crafted in Python, this script offers a versatile solution for enhancing cybersecurity protocols and network management strategies.
